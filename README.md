# Welcome to Stefano Notaro profile page

The purpose of this profile is to guide you to my differents repositories in github.

This page is organized as follow:  
  On the first section are all my github's organizations. There I have all the repositories from the same technology.  
  Ex: In "Angular Repositories" you will see all my Angular repositories, with a link to get into the organization.
  
  Then you have the "Repositories" section.  
  Here is a direct link to the repositories. This ones are organized by organization.
  
  And finally my mail contact.
